# Azure Mobile Apps: Javascript Client SDK

With Microsoft Azure Mobile Apps you can add a scalable backend to your connected client applications in minutes.

To learn more about Azure Mobile Apps, visit the [Mobile Apps documentation](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/learning-paths/appservice-mobileapps/). To understand how to use the Javascript client SDK, refer [How to Use the JavaScript Client Library for Azure Mobile Apps](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/app-service-mobile-html-how-to-use-client-library/).

This repository contains code for the [azure-mobile-apps-client](https://www.npmjs.com/package/azure-mobile-apps-client) npm package and the [cordova-plugin-ms-azure-mobile-apps](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cordova-plugin-ms-azure-mobile-apps) Cordova plugin. The Cordova plugin is published from the [Azure/azure-mobile-apps-cordova-client](https://github.com/Azure/azure-mobile-apps-cordova-client) repository by bundling source code in this repository. Refer [Azure/azure-mobile-apps-cordova-client](https://github.com/Azure/azure-mobile-apps-cordova-client) for more details about the Cordova plugin.

## Usage instructions

 [How to Use the JavaScript Client Library for Azure Mobile Apps](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/app-service-mobile-html-how-to-use-client-library/) explains with samples how to use the SDK for various tasks. You can consume the SDK in one of the following ways.

 1. Reference the SDK Javascript bundle in HTML's script tag
 2. Use the SDK Javascript bundle as a CommonJS module
 3. Use the SDK Javascript bundle as an AMD module
 4. Use the SDK as an npm package

The _latest_ SDK bundle is available at `https://zumo.blob.core.windows.net/sdk/azure-mobile-apps-client.js` and `https://zumo.blob.core.windows.net/sdk/azure-mobile-apps-client.min.js`. 

To use a specific version of the SDK (recommended), use the bundle at  `https://zumo.blob.core.windows.net/sdk/azure-mobile-apps-client.<VERSION>.js` or `https://zumo.blob.core.windows.net/sdk/azure-mobile-apps-client.<VERSION>.min.js`, where `<VERSION>` represents a valid version.

### Sample usage

Here are a few examples of how you can use the SDK.

#### Use the SDK as a Javascript bundle

```
<html>
<head>
    <script src="https://zumo.blob.core.windows.net/sdk/azure-mobile-apps-client.2.0.0-beta5.js"></script>
    <script>
        // Create a reference to the Azure App Service
        var clientRef = new WindowsAzure.MobileServiceClient('https://YOUR-SITE-NAME.azurewebsites.net); 
    </script>
</head>
</html>
```

#### Use the SDK as an npm package

Install the SDK from npm: `npm install azure-mobile-apps-client`

OR

Install the SDK from github: `npm install azure/azure-mobile-apps-js-client`

You can now use it in your Javascript code as follows:
```
var WindowsAzure = require('azure-mobile-apps-client');
// Create a reference to the Azure App Service
var clientRef = new WindowsAzure.MobileServiceClient('https://YOUR-SITE-NAME.azurewebsites.net);
```

You can bundle your Javascript code using either [WebPack](https://webpack.github.io/) or [Browserify](http://browserify.org/).

## Build instructions

To build the SDK bundle yourself, follow these steps:
```
git clone https://github.com/Azure/azure-mobile-apps-js-client.git
cd azure-mobile-apps-js-client
npm install
npm run build
```

The built files will be copied to the `/dist` directory. The bundles for use by a web app in a browser are _azure-mobile-apps-client.js_ and _azure-mobile-apps-client.min.js_. The bundle for use by the [azure/azure-mobile-apps-cordova-client](https://github.com/Azure/azure-mobile-apps-cordova-client) repository is _azure-mobile-apps-client-cordova.js_.

## Running Unit Tests

To run unit tests for the browser, run:
```
npm run browserut
```

## Future work

Brief list of work planned in the future:
- ability to cancel push and pull operations
- triggering a push automatically when a pull is performed
- support for math and date/time functions while querying for records
- callback to allow changing how records are sent to the server during a push
- configurable ID column. Currently ID column has to be named 'id'.

All these will be added over a series of updates in the next few days. Stay tuned!
